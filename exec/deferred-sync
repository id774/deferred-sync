# deferred-sync - The main execution script for deferred-sync.
#
# This script is executed via cron or manually to perform
# incremental backups, system synchronization, and remote transfers.
#
# Features:
#   - Loads configuration from `config/sync.conf`
#   - Executes pre-sync and post-sync scripts if defined
#   - Logs all operations to `JOBLOG`
#   - Sends a notification email upon completion (if configured)
#
# Note:
#   - Ensure that `sync.conf` and required scripts are properly configured.
